# BertTracker
BertTracker is a localization project built for FRC. There are two main components: the Robot and the Dashboard.
## Robot
This is the code that runs on the RoboRIO. It uses two encoders to calculate the current x, y, and theta of your robot, relative to where you started.
## Dashboard
The dashboard runs off of FRCDashbaord and displays the data sent to the Network Tables by the RoboRIO on a top-down view of the field.
